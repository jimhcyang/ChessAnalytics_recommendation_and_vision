This folder stores the notebooks for building a chess engine using the supervised learning approach.

Pipeline:
1. data_generation.ipynb: 
	a. download the original ZST file that contains board positions
	b. process the ZST file and dump JSON files
	c. process JSON files to create input data that contains X: encoded board positions and y: stockfish evaluations

2. ResNet7, ResNet13, PlainNet1, and PlainNet3 model training notebooks using the input data from 1. These models share the same input block and output block. The differences are in the middle layers:
	a. ResNet7 uses seven residual blocks
	b. ResNet13 uses thirteen residual blocks
	c. PlainNet1 uses one plain convolutional block
	d. PlainNet3 uses three plain convolutional blocks

ResNet shows good stability with increased model depth while PlainNet does not. Plain convolutional architecture is not very suitable for representing chess board features.

3. GamePlay: this notebook is a arena that different models play against each other

4. Plots: supplementary notebook that generates model performance metrics plots
